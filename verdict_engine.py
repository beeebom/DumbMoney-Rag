#1. Business Quality (Max 10 Points)
#OE (Return on Equity): If it's above 15%, the stock gets +4 points. If it's just above 10%, it gets +2 points.
#PM (Operating Profit Margin): If it's above 15%, it gets +3 points. If it's just above 10%, it gets +1 point.
#Sales Growth: If the most recent year's sales are higher than the previous year (YoY growth), it gets +3 points.
#2. Financial Health (Max 10 Points)
#Debt to Equity Ratio: The script calculates this by dividing total Borrowings by total Equity (Share Capital + Reserves). If it is very low (under 0.5), it gets +5 points. If it's under 1.0, it gets +2 points.
#Cash vs Profit: If the actual Cash from Operating Activity is greater than the reported Net Profit, it gets +5 points (proving the profits are real cash). If cash is just positive (>0), it gets +2 points.
#3. Valuation (Max 10 Points)
#EPS Growth (Earnings Per Share): If the most recent EPS is higher than the previous year's EPS, it gets a full +10 points. If it didn't grow but is at least positive (the company is profitable), it gets +5 points.
#4. Governance (Max 10 Points)
#Promoter Holding: If the company promoters hold more than 50% of the shares, it gets a full +10 points. If they hold more than 30%, it gets +5 points.
